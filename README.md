# HonorsPhysicsOpticsLab
Kevin Hou, Lizzy Wu, Julia Howard

This is our website for the Optics Unit lab project. We decided to make a website instead of a presentation or prezi.

We are not using any complex libraries, api's, etc. It is pure HTML and CSS and some Javascript for functionality. Due to the limited time constraints, it's not going to be that complex.
